Hello! I'm Jason Tang, and I'm an undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at UC Berkeley with an interest in computer architecture and cybersecurity. I also do some Software Engineering on the side.

I am currently a Lab TA for [EECS 16B](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EECS16B/), which is Berkeley's introductory circuits and devices class. Recently, I conducted research in human-AI interaction under [Professor Park Sinchaisri](https://parksinchaisri.github.io/) in the Berkeley Operations and Behavioral Analytics Lab (BOBALAB), where I investigated non-compliance with artifical intelligence and the impact of vague vs. precise advice-giving. I am also a Senior Mentor for the [CS Mentors](https://csmentors.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) club at Berkeley, where I help other students in Berkeley's data structures class, [CS 61B]( https://datastructur.es/).
